Path planning algorithm based on predetermined shortest distance:
1. Continuously adjust the velocities of the robot's joints based on sensor readings to navigate around obstacles.

2. If the left vision sensor detects an obstacle and the right sensor doesn't, the robot turns right.

3. If the right vision sensor detects an obstacle and the left sensor doesn't, the robot turns left.

4. When the middle vision sensor detects that the robot is deviating from the line, the following steps are executed:
   - If the left sensor doesn't detect the line's end and the right sensor does, the robot turns left.
   - If the right sensor doesn't detect the line's end and the left sensor does, the robot turns right.

5. If both the left and right vision sensors detect the line's end, control shifts to the locator count variable. It increments when a locator is sensed by the proximity sensor. 
   - If the locator count is less than or equal to 1, the robot turns right.
   - If the locator count is greater than 1, the robot turns left.

6. After hitting all four locators, a message is printed indicating that all destinations have been reached, and the robot takes only left turns from this point onwards.

7. As it returns to its initial position, the simulation is stopped.
